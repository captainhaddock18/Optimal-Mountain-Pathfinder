# Optimal-Mountain-Pathfinder
The Optimal Mountain Pathfinder employs Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient pathfinding in mountainous terrain, considering altitude and distance. Customizable parameters enable tailored route planning, with intuitive visualization aiding safer trekking adventures.

## Files

1. **DSA_Project_Matrix_Generation.py**: Python script for generating a matrix. 
2. **DSA_Idea.c**: C code for processing the generated matrix. 
3. **DSA_Project_Data_Visualisation.py**: Python script for visualizing the processed data.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Download Image File**: Before running any code, download the image file required for the project.

2. **Run DSA_Project_Matrix_Generation.py**: Execute this Python script. Make sure the image file is in the same folder as this script. This code will generate an output file called "array.txt".

3. **Run DSA_Idea.c**: Compile and run this C code. Ensure that "array.txt" generated in the previous step is in the same folder. This code will generate an "output_file.txt".

4. **Run DSA_Project_Data_Visualisation.py**: Finally, execute this Python script. Ensure that "output_file.txt" generated in the previous step is in the same folder. This code will generate plots to visualize the processed data.

## Note

- It's crucial to maintain the file dependencies and folder structure as described above for the proper execution of the project.
